# Lost Chapter

_Lost Chapter_ is a dashboard webpage that showcases LoL custom game data among your friends.

Want to know who's the best CSer? The best at securing vision? The one who ints the most? Well Riot Games certainly isn't going to tell you! They don't save custom game stats!

## That's sick! How do I use it?

1. Fork the [_Lost Chapter_ backend](https://github.com/liao-frank/lost-chapter-backend). More instructions in that repository.
2. Visit https://liao-frank.github.io/lost-chapter/ and point the site to your live backend URL.
3. Use the stats to boost your own ego and justify flaming your friends! You are a horrible person! ( ´･･)ﾉ(.\_.`)
