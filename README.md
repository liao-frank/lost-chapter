_Preface: This project is inactive and the repo for the server side is now private. My friends and I have been using a Google Sheet which is easier to maintain. In the future, this project could be migrated to an Apps Script that exists on top of a Google Sheet._

# Lost Chapter

Lost Chapter is a dashboard webpage that showcases LoL custom game data among your friends.

Want to know who's the best CSer? The best at securing vision? The one who ints the most? Well Riot Games certainly isn't going to tell you! They don't save custom game stats!

Under the hood, there also exists a novel implementation of reading ROFL files in TS. If you are interested in that, write to me.
